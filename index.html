    <h2>Boycott Elon Musk</h2>
    <p>Elon Musk, like most toddlers, thrives on attention. Good or bad. The best way to handle a screaming tantrum is to ignore it.</p>

    <h3>Do not buy a Tesla</h3>
    <p>Tesla is how Elon is so rich. There are other electric cars from manufacturers who don't repost Nazi shit. You can do better.</p>

    <h3>Delete your Twitter account.</h3>
    <p>Even if you're posting anti-Elon content, you're still feeding him. With clicks, with advertising dollars. You create the audience he can cater to. You are a number he can pitch to advertisers.</p>

    <h3>Do not click on Twitter links</h3>
    <p>Every click is another dollar in his pocket, and another point he can make about X being the "town square."</p>

    <h3>Do not post screen caps of Twitter links</h3>
    <p>You're still feeding into the culture cachet of Twitter as a source of humor/information</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Do not click on Elon-related news articles</h3>
    <p>News sites know that Elon-related rage bait gets clicks. Do not engage. You do not want to read about him. You do not want to know what he's up to or what  he's said. You are doing literally anything else with your time.</p>
